## Writing code builds mental clarity

Coding requires logical thinking and a structured approach to problem-solving. This process can significantly enhance your mental clarity and cognitive abilities. When you code, you break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks, which improves your analytical skills and ability to think systematically.

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5)); // Outputs: 5
```

The above JavaScript function demonstrates a simple increment operation. Understanding how this code works and debugging any issues it might have can sharpen your logical thinking and attention to detail.
